*"The best arguments in the world won't change anyone's mind. The only thing that can do that is a good story."* - Richard Powers

Extra edition of the week, focusing more on Artificial Intelligence. Take the weekend to explore everything from new tools to a prompting technique I've been enjoying.

## **Frontend**

GSAP Web Animation Toolkit Now Completely Free üöÄ- Last year, the popular GSAP (GreenSock) animation library was acquired by Webflow ‚Äî and this brought great news for the community! Starting with version 3.13, the entire GSAP toolkit is available for free, including previously paid addons like MorphSVGb ([https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin/](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin/)) and SplitText ([https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText/](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText/)). Best of all: usage is allowed even for commercial projects. Link: [https://gsap.com/blog/3-13/](https://gsap.com/blog/3-13/)

‚ÑπÔ∏è Important: Although free, GSAP isn't exactly open source. It uses a "no charge" license that only prevents use in direct competition with Webflow. ([https://gsap.com/community/standard-license/](https://gsap.com/community/standard-license/)).

### **The Next Evolution of Frontend: AI-Powered State Management ü§ñ**

Artificial intelligence is transforming how we handle state management in modern frontend applications. According to The New Stack article, the complexity of managing states in rich interfaces is being reduced thanks to AI-powered solutions that promise to automate and optimize processes that previously required extensive manual configuration and repetitive code.

These new AI-based tools can analyze usage patterns, predict state changes, and even suggest real-time improvements, making frontend development more efficient and less error-prone. The result? Less time spent on hard-to-track bugs and more focus on user experience and innovation.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Important: While AI brings major advances, understanding state management fundamentals is still crucial to make the most of these new solutions and ensure automation works in your project's favor.

## **PRODUCTIVITY AND AI DEV**

üöÄ Boost your development productivity with VS Code, Copilot Tools, and DBCode! I just watched this incredible video from the official Visual Studio Code channel and was impressed by how much you can accelerate database work directly in VS Code. Now, with Copilot Tools and DBCode extensions, it's much easier to write, test, and visualize SQL queries without leaving the editor!

Copilot suggests intelligent queries from natural language prompts, while DBCode allows you to connect, explore, and manipulate databases super intuitively. It's a perfect combination for those who want to save time and focus on what really matters: delivering value with quality code. If you work with data and want to boost your productivity, I highly recommend checking out this video: üîó [https://lnkd.in/dE_haZPf](https://lnkd.in/dE_haZPf)

Worth mentioning: Zed has launched a new AI-powered editing feature called Agent Panel, promising to make the code editor even faster and more efficient. The differentiator is deep AI integration, allowing everything from answering questions about code to making automated changes, all in the background. Zed is open source, built in Rust, and prioritizes privacy, as it doesn't store conversations by default. The editor lets you choose between different AI models, including running locally. Basic use is free, with monthly limits for AI prompts. More details: [Zed: The Fastest AI Code Editor](https://zed.dev/blog/fastest-ai-code-editor)

## **AI TOOLS I'M USING**

üöÄ AI tool I use: ChatLLM from Abacatus.AI - I want to share a tip about an artificial intelligence tool that's making a difference in my daily routine: ChatLLM from Abacatus: [https://chatllm.abacus.ai/sXwQTtgNMl](https://chatllm.abacus.ai/sXwQTtgNMl). I use this platform as my "super AI assistant" because it brings together chat, code generation, voice, images, and even video in one place.

One of the features I use most is the integrated code editor. With it, I can write, test, and adjust code directly on the platform without switching between different tools. This greatly streamlines my workflow, especially when I need to automate tasks, analyze data, or create small scripts quickly.

ChatLLM gives me access to the main AI models in the market and allows me to automate processes, analyze data in real-time, visualize information, and integrate different data sources easily. Additionally, the platform offers security features, monitoring, and evaluation of AI responses, which gives me more confidence to use it both at work and in personal projects.

*Have a great weekend!*
