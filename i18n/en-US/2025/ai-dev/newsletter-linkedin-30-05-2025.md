"Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them." – *Steve Jobs, Apple co-founder.*

## **AI World**

**Startup launches "world's first fully agent-based browser"** - A mysterious startup called Fellou caught attention on social media this week by introducing a new browser that promises to perform complex tasks for you. According to the company, you just need to provide a task, and the browser can open multiple tabs, assign different agents to each step, and navigate pages automatically. It also generates detailed reports, similar to OpenAI's deep research tool. You can sign up to be among the first to test it at [this link](https://fellou.ai/use-cases). *(Still waiting for access and will share everything once I test it.)* Learn more at [fellou.ai](http://fellou.ai/).

"Learning is a journey, not a destination." – *Unknown author.*

**Bio Boost: Anthropic Accelerates Life Sciences Research with AI Credits -** Anthropic has launched a new program that will grant up to $20,000 in API credits to researchers working on "high-impact" projects in biology and life sciences. The initiative aims to accelerate discoveries and innovations in these areas by providing facilitated access to Anthropic's AI resources. Learn more about the program and how to apply at [this link](https://www.anthropic.com/news/ai-for-science-program).

# REFLECTION AND ANALYSIS

The frontend development universe, especially with React, is constantly evolving. For those looking to stay ahead, following React Labs announcements is essential. And the latest April update brought exciting news!

**As highlighted in the official blog:**

"The Big React Labs April Update — From time to time, the React team publishes a 'Labs' post where they update us on important new features and what the team is working on. Here, we learn about two new features ready to try today in react@experimental: View Transitions and the <Activity> component. There are several other features in development as well."

You can read the full post and see the list of other features in development directly on the React blog: [React Labs: View Transitions, Activity, and more](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/23/react-labs-view-transitions-activity-and-more).

But to truly understand what these new features mean, their implications, and how they can change the way we build interfaces...

"...dev YouTuber Theo Browne ▶️ released an essential 40-minute video walking through the entire post and its implications."

This video is a fantastic resource for those who want to go beyond the announcement and absorb the technical and practical details. Theo does a great job explaining the context and potential of these new tools.

**Watch here and deepen your knowledge: [Theo Browne - React Just Changed Forever.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dePNpdd44M)**

Beyond Theo's analysis, it's interesting to note that the community is already exploring, like Jack Whiting's practical example of how to implement View Transitions in a Next.js app (mentioned in the video and online discussions).

This is another reminder of the importance of continuous learning. Tools evolve, new APIs emerge, and our ability to absorb and apply this knowledge is what keeps us relevant and capable of delivering the best possible experiences.
